# :star: Introduction

Shell scripting is the practice of automating tasks using command-line shells. It involves writing scripts that utilize the shell's features to execute a series of commands, perform system operations, and manipulate data. Shell scripts are powerful tools for automating repetitive tasks, managing system configurations, and interacting with the operating system and its utilities. They provide a way to streamline workflows, increase productivity, and customize the behavior of a Unix-like environment.
